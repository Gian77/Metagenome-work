# Metagenome analysis

Before starting, is very important to understand the questions that were behind your metagenomic experiment. What were your goals? Perhaps you were interested in pooling  
out several genes of interest and compare them across treatments; reconstruct and assemble different genomes coming from the same substrate (e.g. MAGs); identify specific taxa and even characterize simple biological communities and their potential functions etc.
